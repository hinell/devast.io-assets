# Devast.io Assets
>_A bunch of scripts to download images from the `devast.io` files (a crappy game made by infamous company)._
>_This repo doesn't contain actual assets filets._

</br>

## Overview
Currently scripts download only images. 

## Requirements
GNU Make installed on your system

## Usage 

Run in cloned repo
```
make
```
The above command will download all missing images listed in the `./assets-img.txt` file into the `img/` folder in the current working directory (about 2482 files).

Note: there might be duplicates. Assets also have shadow duplicates: assets that are modified to represent different condition of in-game items. Like wall during day/night/borken etc.
A lot of duplicates.

## Troubleshooting
By 2023 not all files might be downloadable. Contanct author in case of failures or try to fix script yorself.

## Legal disclaimer

This project is intended for reference only. For commercial use of assets refer to the `devast.io` owner. I personally encourage copying their crappy game whether legally or illegally.
